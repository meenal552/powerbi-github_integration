steps used:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "message"

//  I want to push my changes to Git servers then I will need to tell Git how to reach the central repository. So I will have to add this:
git remote add original https://github.com/meenal552/powerbi-github_integration.git
(git remote add origin here is wrong)

//as whenever I need to send my code changes I need to use this words instead of remembering or typing the URL for the same.

git push -u original master



To check all user details like user name and email:
